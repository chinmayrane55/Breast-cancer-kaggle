# Breast-cancer-kaggle
Classify if the cancer is benign or malignant           link-> https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data

This project is implmented to get well versed with the basics of data science. Data analysis and implmenting most of the classifier algorithms. 

Best testing accuracy received was 100% using Logistic regression, Neural network multiple layer classifier

One may not recieve the same accuracy as random initialization is activated. 

Implemented 4 algorithms
1-> Logistic Regression
2-> Random Forest Classifier
3-> Support vector machines
4-> MLP classifier
5-> Neural network multiple layer classifier
